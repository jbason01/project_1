            <p>Since 2018, I have owned 2 firebirds. The first, shown in the first two pictures was a 1999, and was the base trim. It had 190,000 miles, v6 and automatic transmission. I sold it in 2021, because I had gotten my 2002 Collector Edition in 2020. It had 56,000 miles, (it's now around 63k) t-tops, a v8, and a 6 speed manual transmision. Shown in the last three pictures, it is number 26 out of 2391 ever built. The front right frame rail and core support were entirely replaced, and new body panels were sourced, and painted.</p>
            <p>Left to right, top to bottom: <br>Just after buying my first project car at age 13, $550. <br>How it sat just before I sold it, now running and driving with fresh paint. <br>Auction photo of damage. It was delivered this way and remained like this for over a year until the frame was finally replaced. <br>After I had it repaired, before I had sourced a rocker panel and it had been painted. <br>How it sits today.</p>
